# Country API Documentation

## Overview
This Spring Boot application provides an API for retrieving country information. It exposes a single endpoint to fetch a list of countries based on various filters. The service is designed to be scalable and provides pagination to ensure efficient retrieval of large datasets.

## API Endpoint Details

### GET /countries

Fetches a list of countries based on the provided filters.

#### Parameters:

- **name** (optional)
  - Type: `String`
  - Description: Filters the list by the name of the country. It may support partial matching, depending on the implementation of the service layer.

- **population** (optional)
  - Type: `BigDecimal`
  - Description: Filters the list by the population of the country. The exact matching behavior (e.g., equals, greater than, less than) may depend on the service layer's implementation.

- **order** (optional)
  - Type: `Sort.Order`
  - Allowed Values: `ASC` (Ascending), `DESC` (Descending)
  - Default: `ASC`
  - Description: Determines the sorting order of the returned list based on the country names.

- **page_size** (optional)
  - Type: `int`
  - Range: 1 to 1000
  - Default: 250
  - Description: Specifies the maximum number of countries to return. Helps in paginating large result sets.

#### Response:

- **200 OK**
  - Description: Successfully fetched the list of countries based on the provided filters.
  - Body:
    - A list of `CountryDto` objects, with each object representing details about a country.

- **400 BAD REQUEST**
  - Description: Invalid request parameters, such as invalid values or combination of filters.

- **500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR**
  - Description: Unexpected error on the server side.

#### Example Request:

```http
GET /countries?name=Can&order=DESC&page_size=100
```

This would retrieve a list of countries with names that might start with "Can", ordered in descending order, with a maximum of 100 results.

---

## Models

### CountryDto

Represents details about a country. The exact fields and their types depend on the actual DTO's implementation but typically might include `name`, `population`, `area`, and other relevant country attributes.

### CountryFilterDto

Used internally by the service to represent the filters passed in the request. Contains fields such as `name`, `population`, `order`, and `pageSize`.

## Dependencies

The controller relies on a service (`CountryService`) for fetching the country data. This service is injected via the constructor, and its implementation (`CountryServiceImpl`) determines the actual behavior of the data retrieval and filtering.

---

**Note**: This documentation provides a broad overview of the API's functionality. Depending on the actual service implementation, behaviors such as filtering might vary. Always refer to the service layer's source or documentation for exact behavior details.

================================================================ QUESTION 2: =========================================================================
Generate 10 examples how to use GET /countries endpoint with various query parameters.

Certainly! Here are 10 example usages of the `GET /countries` endpoint with various combinations of query parameters:

1. **Retrieve All Countries with Default Settings**
```http
GET /countries
```

2. **Search for Countries by Name**
```http
GET /countries?name=India
```

3. **Filter Countries by Population**
Assuming the population filter is set to retrieve countries with a population greater than the specified value:
```http
GET /countries?population=100000000
```

4. **Sort Countries in Descending Order**
```http
GET /countries?order=DESC
```

5. **Limit the Number of Results Returned**
```http
GET /countries?page_size=50
```

6. **Search for Countries by Name and Sort in Descending Order**
```http
GET /countries?name=Bra&order=DESC
```
This could retrieve countries with names starting with "Bra" like "Brazil", "Bratislava" etc., sorted in descending order.

7. **Filter by Population and Limit the Number of Results**
```http
GET /countries?population=50000000&page_size=5
```

8. **Search by Name, Filter by Population, and Sort Results**
```http
GET /countries?name=Sw&population=8000000&order=DESC
```
This could retrieve countries with names starting with "Sw" and with a population greater than 8 million, sorted in descending order.

9. **Sort Results in Ascending Order with a Page Size Limit**
```http
GET /countries?order=ASC&page_size=100
```

10. **Comprehensive Example with All Parameters**
```http
GET /countries?name=Can&population=35000000&order=ASC&page_size=10
```
This would retrieve countries with names that might start with "Can", have a population greater than 35 million, ordered in ascending order, with a maximum of 10 results.

Note: The exact behavior of some parameters (like the behavior of the `population` filter) might vary based on the service's implementation. The above examples assume certain behaviors, but the actual results may differ.
